## Strategies Implemented

- **Momentum Investing Strategy :** This project implements a momentum investing strategy using Python. The strategy selects the top 10 stocks with the highest weekly price momentum and the bottom 10 stocks with the lowest weekly price momentum. It then calculates recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio with long positions on the top 10 stocks with price increases and short positions on the bottom 10 stocks with price decreases.
